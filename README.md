# viorica-cirstea – Junior Developer Portfolio

Junior developer learning both C# and Java. I build small projects to understand object‑oriented programming, data types, constructors, methods, and clean coding practices. I enjoy learning step by step, experimenting with console applications, and improving my problem‑solving skills through hands‑on practice. I also bring experience and a strong Human Resources background that enhances teamwork, communication, and adaptability. Motivated to grow into a reliable and versatile developer.
